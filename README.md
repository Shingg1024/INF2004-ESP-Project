# INF2004-ESP-Project-T22
### Project Description:
Our project centers around utilizing the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to design and develop an autonomous two-wheeled robot car that incorporates a range of sensors. The implementation of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller will be a major element of our robot. The major goal is to create a robot car capable of efficiently maneuvering through a predefined course while avoiding obstacles and identifying barcodes using infrared sensors. The use of a PID controller improves the car's control system, ensuring precise and seamless movement throughout both navigation and barcode scanning processes. 

### Project Objectives:
1. Robot Car Construction: Assemble and construct the 2-wheel robot car, ensuring mechanical stability and precision wheel control.
2. Sensor Integration: Integrate ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, infrared sensors for line following and barcode recognition, and a magnetometer for orientation.
3. Navigation and Mapping: Implement navigation algorithms that guide the robot car along the track, while avoiding obstacles and optimizing for efficiency.
4. Barcode Recognition: Develop algorithms to enable the car to detect and interpret barcodes on the ground using infrared sensors.
5. PID Controller: Design and implement a PID controller to regulate the robot car's speed and steering, ensuring smooth and precise movement.
6. Efficiency and Speed Optimization: Optimize the navigation and PID control algorithms to achieve the shortest track completion time while accurately recognizing barcodes.
7. User Interface: Create a user interface that allows users to initiate the robot, adjust parameters, visualize the car's performance, and monitor PID controller behavior.
8. Documentation, and Testing: Thoroughly document the project's design, construction, programming, challenges faced and insights gained. Additionally,
conduct comprehensive testing to validate the functionality and performance of the developed solution, ensuring its robustness and reliability.
